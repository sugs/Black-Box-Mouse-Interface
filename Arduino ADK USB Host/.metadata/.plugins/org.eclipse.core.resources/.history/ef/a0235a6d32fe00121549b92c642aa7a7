/**
 	// GENERAL INFO ABOUT USB DEVICE FUNCTIONS
    // This is the procedures to gain access to the
    // sensor values on the remote sensors.
    // This document is meant to be a guideline for
    // the future application layer protocol developemnt.

    // This state is accessed when the Arduino ADK
    // (Ground station) needs to map out the network at hand.
    // This state requests a status report from the router, and the
    // router sends a report of all sensors available and their ids and
    // data types (includes number of bytes to allocate for the rx buffer).

    // NOTE: The IF(REMEMBER) condition is implemented using the DB.h
    // library found on Arduino.com. It uses the EEPROM to store information\
    // about the configuration.

    #if(ID_REQUEST)


         * This function sends_a wakeup call to the router and makes the
         * router go into command polling mode. This allows the router to
         * only react to the commands sent by the ground station and not the
         * sensors.
         *
         * -> This function needs an ack before a watchdog timer expires
         *    to continue with the setup process.

*******  1. send_wakeup_router();
                -> receive_router_ack();
                -> ping_router


         * This function requests a router status structure. It sends a
         * request command and polls until a structure is returned or when a
         * watchdog timer exhaust is caught.
         *
         * -> This function needs an ack before a watchdog timer expires
         *    to continue with the setup process.

*******  2. request_router_status();
                -> receive_router_status();


         * This function is very crucial to the network implementation, as
         * it maps out the receiver and sender nodes. This function sends a
         * generic "nmap" command, which activates a network_read() command on
         * the router. Then in turn, the router returns a network structure,
         * which contains enddevice information and other crucial network info.
         *
         * -> This function needs a message before a watchdog timer expires
         *    to continue with the setup process.

*******  3. request_net_map();
                -> receive_nmap();


                 * This part of the code stores the received network info in
                 * non-volatile EEPROM for future storage.\

                ENDIF


         * Now that the network topology is mapped out, the follwoing command
         * is issued to all endpoint devices (sensors) to acquire their
         * respective specifics, such as channel IDs, speed and data types.
         *
         * -> This function needs a message before a watchdog timer expires
         *    to continue with the setup process.

*******  4. request_sensor_channel_info();
                -> receive_channel_info();


                 * This part of the code stores the received network info in
                 * non-volatile EEPROM for future storage.\

         * This function polls for an enabled sensor report generated by the
         * user on the router, by slecting which sensor is enabled.

*******  5. get_user_enable_sensors();
                -> set_flags(byte sensor flags);


         * Then to finalize the ground station network initialization,
         * we need to allocate buffers for each sensor and then create a
         * call priority table, which in other words is a call scheduler.
         * This finalizes the network setup on the ground station side.
         *
         * -> This function needs a message before a watchdog timer expires
         *    to continue with the setup process.

*******  6. configure_ground_station();

    // and we are requesting data from the router.

                 * This function sends a wakeup message to the router, which
                 * in its turn sends a wakeup signal to the remote node
                 * specified in the agument passed.

                 * which then gets a sensor responce structure back. The sequence
                 * in which this process is done is with the call_priority_table
                 * defined above. We go through the table and call each sensor
                 * to get each peice of information.

                 * This function receives a router ACK structure, and also receives,
